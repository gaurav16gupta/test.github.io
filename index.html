	<p>As this is the first blog post on this website (and indeed, by myself), the introduction had to be done. I’ll leave 			it at this, though. If you want to know more about me, you can do that here.
		 This website is created using the Hugo static website generator. You define the layout of your pages using 		    regular HTML (combined with Hugo’s templates), CSS and JavaScript and you write your pages’ contents using 			 Markdown. Hugo takes these source files and generates the HTML files for you. All you have to do afterwards is 		deploy these files on your server</p>
