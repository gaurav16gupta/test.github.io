	<p>I have been working on research projects in the field of Computer vision, Machine learning, Deep learning and Augmented reality. Following are the project that I have worked on-
1) Design of robust Marker Based Forehead Motion Tracker for a customer specific project. The
tracker is being used for objective analysis of ADHD and Autism.
2) An application of Indoor localization System for Google Glass. We have made Visual Odometry and Inertial Sensor based Sensor Fusion model for locating position in unknown environment.
3) An Augmented Reality based Inspection Framework for Android Devices (Google Glass, Google Cardboard, Tablets). The developed framework is reconfigurable for Inspection of any
object provided checklists with set of questions and trained RCNN model for object detection.
4) Currently working for Text recognition in street shop images using both neural networks and traditional vision tools.
While working here I learnt key technologies of Machine Learning, Image Processing, Android app development, Convolutional Neural Networks, Database Structure, Classification and Clustering, Algorithms and Motion Tracking.</p>
